## CLUSTERING PROGRAM FOR SMALL DATA

Hello, you are on my project. This project helped me master Python, data structures and algorithms in Python and more.

A little history? It was my teacher at school who taught us the problem of clustering in AI. And to master the concept behind this “clustering” problem, she asked us to calculate using the theory she gave us during the course. And this will be considered an exam. And because "I'm so lazy", yeah, it's true. You read it right, because I'm a lazy guy, I decided to work on this project.

And I faced some challenges... When I had the idea, I thought it would be so simple... but it's definitely not the case because I revised a base of Python base to carry out this project.
