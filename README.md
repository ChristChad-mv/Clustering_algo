## CLUSTERING PROGRAM FOR SMALL DATA

Hey there, 
You're on my project. This project helped me to master python, data structures & algo in Python and more.

A little history ?
It was my teacher at school teach me a clustering problem in AI. 
And for master the concept behind this problem 'clustering', the asked us to calculate using the theory that she gave us during the course. And, it will be considered like a exam.
And because "I'm so lazy" yeahh that's right. You read it corretly, because I'm a lazy guy I decide work on this project.

And I faced some challenges...
When I got the idea, i thought that will be so easy...but it defintly not the case because I review some python core foundation to do this project.
