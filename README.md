## CLUSTERING PROGRAM FOR SMALL DATA

Hello, you are on my project. This project helped me master Python, data structures and algorithms and much more.
It's a console application.

A little history? It was my teacher at school who taught us the problem of clustering in AI. And to master the concept behind this “clustering” problem, she asked us to calculate using the theory she gave us during the course. And this will be considered as an exam. And because "I'm so lazy", yeah, it's true. You read it right, because I'm a lazy guy, I decided to build this project. This algorithm that can help for that.

And I faced some challenges... When I had the idea, I thought it would be so simple... but it's definitely not the case because I revised a base of Python base to carry out this project.
